# Writing up articles as a blog post

1. Quick scan through, capture quoted sections of text as you go with interesting points to highlight or remember
  - save this as draft document in personal notebook 'blog-posts' section, with link to source article
  - capture all relevant links in the article for later reading

2. Write a summary sentence (paragraph at most) on what the article is about, and why it's interesting
  - save this summary and article link in relevant themed link files in personal notebook

3. Go back through each block of text, rewrite with my own understanding of content, and form separate blocks into themes.

4. Refine as blog post in blog repo, retain original content in personal notebook repo
  - put a link at top of file to blog post so we know it's been published
  - move file to 'published-blog-posts' folder

Try not to head down a rabbit hole with the content and links:

- make notes for further blog posts

- the goal here is to get this one article content written up and published

As an example remember what happened with the "deep learning eating software" rabbit hole:

- one article turned into 3 links

- which turned into another 5 links

- which turned into an idea for writing up ideas for where we can apply deep learning to augment our tasks
