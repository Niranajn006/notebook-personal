## Portfolio: Flight delays and cancellations

- [Kaggle Dataset: 2015 flight delays and cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays)
    - on-time performance of domestic flights, 2015 flight delays and cancellations

- [Kaggle Dataset: Airline on-time statistics and delay causes](https://www.kaggle.com/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses)
    - Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights
    - This version of the dataset was compiled from the Statistical Computing Statistical Graphics 2009 Data Expo

- [Data Expo 09: Exploring domestic airline traffic with the RITA on-time performance dataset](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/posters/)
    - [Supplemental data sources](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/supplemental-data.html)
    - [RITA: Airline on-time performance](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/)
        - flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, Oct 1987 to Apr 2008
        - When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
        - Do older planes suffer more delays?
        - How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
        - How well does weather predict plane delays?
        - Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?
        - Compare flight patterns before and after 9/11
