    - not available in bookstore yet (2018-04-16)

- Blog with similar gitbook journal format currently in use.
    - In each weeks folder, have a `tasks.md` file to store the GTD tasks identified during the week.
    - If using something like Gatsby, modify the GraphQL query to filter out this file when building production site.
    - This allows tracking personal tasks without publishing them.
