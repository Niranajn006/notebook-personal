### Data Analysis

- [Big data vs Hayek](https://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2015/06/28/big-data-versus-hayek/#54dd17744e70)
    - uber uses central algorithms to set prices, rather than letting drivers set prices
    - airbnb does not, instead providing ratings and informational systems to help buyers and sellers overcome informational asymmetries
    - in some places centralised algorithms are replacing decentralised knowledge and decision making
    - but the markets are evolving as well

- [Power in the age of the feudal internet](https://blog.usejournal.com/power-in-the-age-of-the-feudal-internet-20e106a2e2ce)
    - the vision of a free and open internet has been replaced by government firewalls, Internet Service Provider surveillance, and corporate data harvesting
    - Each new form of media — the telegraph, telephone, radio, film, and television — was born free and open but later evolved into a closed and controlled industry or monopoly.
