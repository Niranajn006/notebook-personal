### Data Science

- [How machine learning is creating new professions](https://www.ft.com/content/49e81ebe-cbc3-11e7-8536-d321d0d897a3)
    - many of the people coming into the field do so without formal training provided by higher education institutes
    - need to make use of collected data in centralised data stores has created a sudden demand for specialists
