## Portfolio project idea

Model a pipeline efficiency based on day job work.

e.g. 10,000 raw input, with 0.2x pipeline efficiency modifier for that combination of segments, results in 2,000 units output.

- nested segments, e.g. segment A has components A1 and A2, with A1 containing AA1 and AA2
  - goes down to more granular levels

- pipeline stages, each with different section modifiers

- variable unit value based on segment combinations

- variable pipeline efficiency based on segment combinations

Can use lower number of segments and components initially to make modelling simpler.

- some form of matrix with modifiers

- can fall back to parent section if nested sections don't have a modifier
