### D3 ideas

- [Flight animation with D3.js](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2014-04-02)

- ![Journey path reveals on hover over](http://eng.uber.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blog_arcs.gif)
    - use this to visualise routes from airports, drawn over a regional (Europe) or global map

### Druid

Funnel analysis in Druid, plugin architecture, how?

Raw csv files
Ingestion script to load csv into Druid and persist to volume, so can set up from fresh check out
- streaming ingestion? Then can use the same technique to add daily data in when system live

Immutable segment for base data, OHLC etc that won't change once written. Means its read optimised.

Batch vs Streaming ingestion
