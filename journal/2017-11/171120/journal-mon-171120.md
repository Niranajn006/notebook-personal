It feels like I've been in purgatory, halfway between worlds. Trying to move from engineering into the data science discipline, but not really existing in either right now.

## Thoughts

- move all personal content out of `work-journal` and into `notebook-personal`. Be aware `notebook-personal` is published on `git push` so double check content to ensure nothing sensitive.

- daily rapid log everything to work journal to capture data. At end of day when curating content for backup to repo, then split out into work and personal notebooks.

- create a loose form of 'initiatives' for personal learning path / projects

- initiatives folder as well as collections folder. Collections describes an overview / context of a project, initiatives are broken down implementation concepts for the projects

## Current Goals

- Portfolio of work to demonstrate abilities

- Ability to analyse companies for worthwhile investment

- Build data science skill set

## What areas do I want to work on?

**Portfolio of applicable data science skills**

- machine learning

- neural networks

**Stock analysis data product**

- use as a portfolio piece

- act as a tool to learn investment methodologies and concepts

- build a LSE dataset which can be used for playing with ML techniques
