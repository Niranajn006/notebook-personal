Am I better just paying £25 / month for a tool, that's effectively 1 hour of my time, and it would take me longer to build my own.

Then I can concetrate on stock selection rather than building architecture and infrastructure.

It also allows me to get ideas of visualisations and areas to investigate for if I build my own tool.

    - $50 LSE end of day data for last 10 years
    - $25/month ongoing end of day data for LSE

the correct form to calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient is between stock returns. So, first you'll need to calculate the daily returns of the stocks: Adj Close - Previous Day Adj Close.﻿
