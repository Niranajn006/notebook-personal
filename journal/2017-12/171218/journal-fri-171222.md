Gapminder case study in chapter 5 of DataCamp 'Data Cleaning' could be a good portfolio piece.

## Ideas

Sharescope as stock screener
- once identified interesting stocks can then get specific stock data for scripts

Find an interesting dataset I can showcase a number of examples on.

Build an airflow pipeline on the data.
Load the data into Druid and build the analytics dashboard on top of it.
Build some form of API on top of data that serves a predictive model.

Use Kaggle datasets as they will be larger?

Can I tie DataCamp learning videos together with representative data sets?

? 'Courses Completed' and 'Books Read' sections on personal blog / notebook

Combine statistical modeling in R with 'Statistics using R' textbook.
- when to study statistical methods, what benefit will it bring to portfolio work?

- Use *Machine Learning with the Experts: School Budgets* as a proxy for classification of personal finance items
    - "I am a firm believer in automating all the boring stuff, so I wrote a model to classify my personal expenditure; every month I download all my personal finance statements and consolidate them to a single data source. But going through each transaction and classifying it (food, fuel, gifts, entertaining etc) is a time consuming and laborious process. I considered sanitising my data and publishing it as an example data set, until I found this public dataset, so I used the same techniques as a demonstration."
