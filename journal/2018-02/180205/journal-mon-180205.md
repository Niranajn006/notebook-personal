### Vertical Slicing

This enables us to “maximize the work not done”, by apply our resources in small increments, and only continuing to work on projects that continue to deliver value. If you’ve ever done a lot of work to create a great result that no one used, this is the approach for you!

The traditional workflow is like a layer cake: we build a project layer by layer, and when it’s done and frosted, we deliver the results. Vertical slicing focuses on changing this in two ways:

- Vertical: tackle the work in a way that gets all the way from the bottom layer to the top, so there is actual value to the end user produced

- Slice: narrow the scope to the least amount of work that can deliver some value

The end result of this practice is that we can get feedback with as little work as possible, and determine whether to continue with the next vertical slice or devote resources elsewhere.
