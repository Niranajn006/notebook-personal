## Keeping Up With the Quants

```
Thoughts -> Actions -> Habits -> Character -> Destiny
```

```
Problem Recognition -> Review of previous findings -> Modeling (variable selection) -> Data collection (measurement) -> Data analysis -> Results presentation and action
```

### Steps

1. My understanding of the business problem

2. How I will measure the business problem

3. What data is available

4. The initial solution hypothesis

5. The solution

6. The business impact of the solution


### Three Stages and Six Steps of Quantative Analysis

1. Framing the problem
    1. Problem recognition
        - identifying the stakeholders for the analysis
        - focus on decisions that will be made as a result of the analysis
        - what type of analytical story are you telling?
    2. Review of previous findings

2. Solving the problem
    3. Modeling
    4. Data collection
    5. Data analysis

3. Communicating and Acting on results
    6. Results presentation and action

### Identifying the stakeholders

- documenting stakeholders needs

- assessing and analysing stakeholders interest/influence

- managing stakeholders expectations

- taking actions

- reviewing status and repeating

### Scope of the problem

- testable hypotheses

- be specific about what you want to find out

### Review of previous findings

- has a story similar to this been told before?

- what kind of story could we tell?

- what kind of data are we likely to want to look for?

- how have variables been defined before?

- what type of analyses are we likely to perform?

- how can we tell the story in an interesting way, that is different from past stories, and also likely to get results?

### Solving the problem

- modeling (variable selection) step

- data collection (measurement) step
    - binary
    - categorical / nominal
    - ordinal
    - numerical

- can you use secondary data (data collected by someone else)

- data analysis

### Telling a story with data

- come up with your ending before you figure out your middle

- the conclusion of your analysis is the only reason you are telling the story

- when you finish what do you want your audience to know?

- more importantly, what do you want your audience to do?

- what's the essence of your story, and the most economical telling of it?

- tell the basics of your story in 3-5 sentences

**What type of story are you telling?**

- csi story

- eureka story

- mad scientist

- survey

- prediction

- "here's what happened"

### Coefficient of Variation (COV)

It measures the percentage of variation around the arithmetic mean of a series, and is calculated as follows:

```
Coefficient of Variation = Standard Deviation / Mean
```

It is commonly used as a measure of volatility in demand to assess the predictability of a demand pattern, that is, how well it can be forecasted. If COV >1.0, it can be said that variations in demand are high, and thus, statistical techniques should not be applied without further review.

### Forecast Value Added (FVA)

FVA is a metric for evaluating the performance of each step and each participant in the forecasting process to determine which one adds value and which one does not, so that the one that does not can be eliminated. For example, each forecast may have many touch points; some of them add value to the forecast and others make it worse. The objective of FVA analysis is to determine which touch points (activities) help and which don’t, so that one can eliminate those that don’t help. The override of one person may improve the forecast; while of others makes it worse. The metric-to-measure performance may be Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), bias, or any other.
