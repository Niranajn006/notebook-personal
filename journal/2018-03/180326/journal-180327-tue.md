> When it became apparent that the CFT was not succeeding in improving accuracy, we came under considerable pressure from  senior levels. Rather than argue the case for patience, our response was to lock down processes and work on compliance. This simply meant that we did the wrong things more consistently.

> My learning from this experience is to improve the process first by unleashing creativity. Only standardize processes afterward, as a way of spreading good practice.
