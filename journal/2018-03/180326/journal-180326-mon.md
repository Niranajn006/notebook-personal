> Profit came from the spread between how much he paid for a security and how much he sold it for. In volatile times, the spread widened, reflecting the increased risk that the market might move against him before he had the chance to trade out of his position.

> The thing that really set Hayes apart was his ability to spot patterns of price anomalies and exploit them, a technique known as *"relative value trading"*. If he thought that the the price of two similar securities had diverged unduly, he would buy one and short the other, betting that the spread between the two would shrink.

> A basis trade is betting that the gap between LIBOR in different durations would widen or narrow.
