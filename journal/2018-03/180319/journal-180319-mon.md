## What do I want to achieve?

I need to become very focused on what I actually want to achieve. Too diffuse fragments of ideas and things that feel 'nice' or are interesting, won't allow me to actually achieve anything. I'll waste all my time just bouncing from one interesting thing to the next, without actually producing anything tangible.

### Portfolio of skillsets

- forecasting

- data science; exploratory analysis, data engineering, data-driven products

### Investment Learnings

- what am I actually to trying to achieve here?
    - *"Because it is interesting"* is not a valid answer.

The best way to invest the money with the means I have, to provide a future as we grow older.

A lot of options are not applicable, because I don't have the levels of money, the data sources, and the trading knowledge to work the same way as 'traditional' investors.

## Capturing Related Information

Gitbook formats are great for focused, related collections of posts.

Maybe not so much for unrelated capturing of thoughts, ideas, and research references. For these, something like the blogging data formats maybe, with metadata so you can add categories. 

This way you can easily navigate to all the related material on that category - for example, a category of 'feature engineering' would return a list of links to journal entries with paper write ups, links to interesting articles, thoughts and ideas etc.

## Info Hoarding Habits

[Warning signs your thirst for knowledge is jeopardising your success](http://www.theshapeshiftersclub.com/6-warning-signs-your-thirst-for-knowledge-is-jeopardising-your-success/)

I was loosing track of the multiple projects, courses, books I was handling at the time.

Maybe you feel like you’re keeping too many irons in the fire.

Reading more than you can digest?

Learning more than you can put into practice?

Have you ever thought that thirst for knowledge may be just an info-hoarding habit, and all those books, articles and certificates, instead of helping you progress, are drowning your chances of success?

**Your 'to read' pile keeps growing**

Yes, I love reading, too. And even more, I love books. Books make you feel like you’re investing in yourself and your success, don’t they?

Books, trade publications, opinion magazines – shelves and online stores are full of stuff to serve every need and suit every taste.

So you buy more and more and add to your ‘to-be-read’ (TBR) pile. You honestly promise yourself, you’ll read it all when you have time.

But reading through it all won’t help you much.

Why?

Because by the time you get to the bottom of your pile, many of the books or articles there will be ‘old news’.

Your ‘knowledge’ will be out-dated.

Every time you’re tempted to add another book/article/course/conference to your ‘to-do’ list or pile, ask yourself: Does it really add value to your work, your personal development, the quality of life?

**Your working memory is on its last legs**

How many brilliant ideas that popped into your have you forgot before you had a chance to write them down?

Do you loose your train of thought when speaking at meetings?

Do trainings and conferences feel like ‘in one ear and out the other’?

These are signs of working memory malfunction. If you’ve noticed any of them, chances are, it’s because your mind is cluttered.

You’re holding too much stuff in your head at the same time. You’re ‘multitasking’, trying to absorb large amount of information in a short time, or handling more than one stream of data coming your way (like chatting on the phone and checking your emails).

It’s more than your memory can take.

**Your plans rarely get completed**

People who spend time collecting information, gathering data and ‘acquiring knowledge’, call it what you like, don’t have time to execute their ideas.

Planning, no matter how thorough, and polishing your plans, will never take you to your goals.

It’s actions that get your there.

But if you always have some more research to do, facts to check, people to ask for opinion, you will never have time and energy for action.

You’re daydreaming, or overthinking, overcomplicating, or being a perfectionist.

Done is better than perfect.

### Be ruthless or drown

Stop searching and adding. **Start doing**.

Simplify.

Decide what really matters to you – here and now.

Purge.

Edit.

Declutter.

Go on an info diet.

Learn to say no.

## Ryan Holiday's notecard taking system

Actually a system developed by Robert Greene, as Ryan apprenticed under him.

## Idea Index

Taken from Cal Newport's blog post on [Deep habits: Creating an idea index](http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/10/23/deep-habits-create-an-idea-index/).

Ideas for more efficient note taking notes on books you are reading.

Previously, he got frustrated by the inefficiency of notetaking. Standard strategy was to mark interesting passages with a pencil and put a check in the upper corner so you can quickly skip non-annotated pages.

Problem with this strategy is that after time the only way to recreate what you learned or found useful is to skim through *all* the marked pages.

A better solution is the **idea index**:

- As you read, create an index at the front of the book that lists its most interesting ideas

- Every time you encounter a passage relevant to one of those ideas add the page to the relevant line in the index. If it's a new idea, then create a new line in the index for it.

When you pick up a book later on, you can quickly recall the interesting parts by glancing at the index, and get more detail by going direct to the referenced pages.

### Scientific Papers

Also works for scientific papers - keep a notebook with an index at the front of titles and brief descriptions of particularly interesting papers, that reference pages later in the notebook summarising why the paper is interesting or useful.

### eBooks / Kindle

Yellow highlight and annotate (write in the margins) interesting sections of the book as you read.

Then, from your Kindle account cut and paste all the highlights and notes into your electronic note store, along with a high level summary of the book and a list of (3) key takeaways from the book.

Finish off by creating a digital index of the ideas and interesting passages.
