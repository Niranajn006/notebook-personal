# Introduction

Personal notebook with what I'm working on, thoughts and ideas, and what I've been reading.

**Important: the text/content here will be as quick and hacky as possible!**

The idea is just to capture information, if I want to make it pretty for public consumption then I will spend the time and effort turning it into a blog post on my personal site.

## Links to read

Recently a colleague asked me a question that I knew I had read a good article on a couple of months previously, but couldn't remember the link to the article.

Going back through old journals I realised that keeping track of what I have read, and what I want to read is proving increasingly difficult.

So the intention is to store all links here, rapid logging them to a daily log so I don't need to keep them in my head, then organising the article themes into collections and writing a quick summary as I read them if I feel they are worth retaining.

This section is purely for me to capture links, it has virtually no curation and is not intended to be 'pretty', rather a raw unfiltered capture of links.

### Ideas

- Use `[] [blah](http://read.me)` notation for links, so can `[x]` as I read each link?
