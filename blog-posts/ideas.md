## Flight tracking with Raspberry Pi and a USB TV tuner

Using a RaspberryPi and a cheap USB TV tuner stick you can tune into the tracking radio signals emitted by planes up to 250 miles away.

I live near to the airport so there is always planes coming in, and both my partner and I love to travel. Sure I could just install a free Android app to find out when she's going to be landing, but where is the fun in that!
