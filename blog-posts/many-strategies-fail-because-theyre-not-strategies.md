# Many strategies fail because they're not strategies

[Many strategies fail because they're not strategies](https://hbr.org/2017/11/many-strategies-fail-because-theyre-not-actually-strategies)

> Many strategy execution processes fail because the firm does not have something worth executing. A real strategy involves a clear set of choices that define what the firm is going to do and what it’s not going to do.

> Many so-called strategies are in fact goals. “We want to be the number one or number two in all the markets in which we operate” is one of those. It does not tell you what you are going to do; all it does is tell you what you hope the outcome will be. But you’ll still need a strategy to achieve it.

> Others may represent a couple of the firm’s priorities and choices, but they do not form a coherent strategy when considered in conjunction.

Small number of clear goals, which fit together to form a clear strategic direction for the company. A set of a limited number of choices that fit together is easy to communicate, which means they are easy to remember. If employees can't remember the goals, then your choices won't influence their behaviour, in which case you don't have a strategy.

If the employees understand the reasoning behind the choices, they are more likely to believe in them, and work towards them in their day to day work.

> Without a clear strategic direction, any implementation process is doomed to fail.

> “Successful firms are characterized by maintaining bottom-up internal experimentation and selection processes while simultaneously maintaining top-driven strategic intent.”

> You need a clear, top-down strategic direction. But this will only be effective if, at the same time, you enable your employees to create bottom-up initiatives that fall within the boundaries set by that strategic intent.
