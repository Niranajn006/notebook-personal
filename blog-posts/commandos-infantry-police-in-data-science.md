# Commandos, Infantry and Police in Data Science

I have been an engineer for a while now, and was fortunate to be in a good team when agile and lean methodologies were starting to get traction. Data science is a wonderfully exciting field to be in but I keep seeing patterns reoccuring, as the applied field is growing and evolving we come up against similar challenges. One of these reminded me of a [wonderful post by Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/commandos-infantry-and-police/) (which itself came from the 'Accidental Empires' book by Robert X. Cringely), talking about three distinct groups of people that operate in a product timeline.

A lot of strategy comes from military concepts, mostly because it is one of the oldest pursuits leading teams of people trying to outperform others. A military operation is analgous to company growth and evolution; both require strategy, tactics, supply lines, communication and manpower. So please bear with the abstract metaphors and try to conceive how the terminology would fit with your environment today.

## Abstract

The field of battle is always changing. What is needed to take the beach might not be the best thing for holding it, and that in turn might not work for winning the local population over.

Small focused units scout the terrain, use maximum determination and targeted force in a concentrated area to amplify their impact. The infantry support them and slog it out to establish a presence, then secure the position once it is taken, strengthen the defenses and build the supply lines to keep everything moving forward. Now we have a beachhead we need to keep everything running smoothly with minimum disruption, otherwise we can't push out and focus on the next objective.

We need all of these functions to keep making headway, and what works in one stage can be counter productive in another. Blowing a hole in a wall to get to the other side quickly won't make you friends if the homeowner is sat in their front room, nor will parking a tank on their prized rose bed. But both these actions performed at the right time and in the right circumstances can make a substantial difference to winning or losing.

The fun part is working out what strategy, tactics and people to use at any given moment - are you crawling out of the surf onto the beach, fighting a pitched battle or building your supply lines and defending your position from your competitors?

Now we have suitably digressed I want to think about how these analogies apply within a data science project.

## Commandos

Commandos are the first wave, who quietly crawl ashore at night to establish a beachhead before the enemy even know they exist. Their job is to hit hard, not always with the most elegant solutions, but to get the job done in the shortest possible time, and make the most impact through teamwork, speed and surprise.

They are the startup, the product prototype and the experimental hypothesis. Here is where innovation, rapid prototyping and unique approaches are all strengths.

This could be a good fit for a Data Scientist doing the exploratory analysis, talking to the stakeholders, finding new data, building models and getting buy-in from the business that a project is worth doing.

## Infantry

Supporting the first wave are the infantry, they hit the beach in larger numbers, secure the beachhead and build the infrastructure to keep everything moving. 

They are the troops that take the prototype, test, refactor and improve it, make it work in production, write the documentation and market the product. They use procedures, design patterns and established practises to standardise components and make things easier to maintain and control.

These could be the Machine Learning Engineers who take the early prototypes, models and data sources, then work out how to get everything working together, in a way that will scale and be resilient.

## Police

Once we've got a defensible position with the necessary supply chains and procedures in place the commandos and infantry head off to take the next objective. The police fill the gap making sure everything set up continues to run, the procedures and rules are followed, and order is maintained.

They are the support, compliance and maintenance teams. They keep the lights on, everything running, monitor and control any changes.

These could be the security, monitoring and infrastructure engineers. They keep the services running, make sure changes won't degrade the existing systems, perform maintenance and check that performance is acceptable.

## Transition

We've called out three distinct types here that we'll see in a product lifetime, but that's not to say they have to be three different people. You need to work out what role is most appropriate for the environment you are currently in, and transition between them at times.

This is where the danger lies - acting like a commando when you need to be establishing your processes leads to products that become harder to maintain and a reputation for poor quality work. But acting like the police at a time when you should be agile, moving rapidly to test new ideas and prototypes will kill innovation and lead to resentment.

## Closing thoughts

Hopefully you got enough of an idea from this post to think of times when each role was appropriate in your own experiences. They are not fixed transitions either - testing hypotheses, finding something that works, making it ready for production then maintaining it, are phases you will go through repeatedly in a product lifecycle.

All of these roles are important at varying stages, the challenge is being in the right role at the right stage.

I highly recommend reading Jeff Atwood's [original post](https://blog.codinghorror.com/commandos-infantry-and-police/), it goes into a lot more detail than I did here.

Happy hunting!
