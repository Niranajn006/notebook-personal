# How to break into machine learning

> becoming the go-to person for everyone’s questions about machine learning is a fantastic way to teach yourself the essentials

I made a list of interesting competitions, focusing on the featured competitions as they should all have winners interviews, then tried to break this list down into applications and techniques, for example, *"market basket analysis"*, *"classification"*, *"recommender system"* etc. Then I went through the winners interviews and forum posts on each competition to build up a picture of what tools and approaches people used for the competition, and where I found something I didn't know or looked interesting I tried to replicate their approach and findings.

The whole aim of this exercise was to build up a toolbox of approaches and familiarity with problem types, the idea being when I come across a project in future I can relate it back to one of these competitions and have a starting point for ways to break the problem down and what to try initially.

> the most frustrating thing about machine learning is how arbitrary it all is. I’m lucky enough to be at a large company surrounded by people I can talk to about things like why my model isn’t learning, but most engineers don’t have that luxury. That’s another advantage of Kaggle, from what I’ve seen their forums offer a lot of support and encouragement. I would also look out for real-world meetups where you can swap stories and commiserate.

> by carefully documenting the process and making sure I could reproduce it consistently, I learned a lot about how it all works. I also got a lot of helpful feedback as I shared drafts of the guide with colleagues.

One thing I'm pushing for at work is to make things repeatable and reproducible. There's still a lot of bespoke environments where each person has a different set up, and a lot of "it worked on my machine". I don't like sharing a project until I'm relatively confident it will work on anyone's machine, regardless what base OS they are using.

> people are a lot more willing to correct somebody else’s mistaken ideas than they are to propose their own. As long as you’re happy to keep eating humble pie, that means writing up your own tentative understanding and getting it reviewed is a lot more effective way of getting others to share their knowledge than asking flat out!

> Having practical experience, even just on competitions like Kaggle, will be a lot more helpful in interviews.

Courses are good for building knowledge, but practical experience of applying that knowledge is always stronger I think. But I'm biased, I've spent my entire life learning through on the job training and application, the downside is it means you're not as broad as other people, but you can try and address that through self learning and reading everything you can get your hands on.
