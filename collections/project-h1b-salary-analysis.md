<App {...state}
startTicker={::this.startTicker} startParticles={::this.startParticles} stopParticles={::this.stopParticles} updateMousePos={::this.updateMousePos}
/>

In case you were wondering, that {::this.startTicker} syntax comes from ES2016. Itâ€™s equivalent to {this.startTicker.bind(this)}. Enable stage-0 in your Babel config to use it.


*D3 creating a rectangle*

	d3.select("svg")
	  .append("g")
	  .attr("transform", "translate(50, 20)")
	  .append("rect")
	  .attr("width", 100)
	  .attr("height", 200);

*Same code in React*

	render() {
	  return (
	    <svg>
	      <g transform="translate(50, 20)"> <rect width="100" height="200" />
	      </g>
	    </svg>
	  );
	}

componentWillMount runs just before React inserts the component into the DOM
componentWillUpdate runs just before React updates the DOM component.
Both get called on any prop change or `setState` call.

All d3 layouts let you define a `.value()` which lets the layout know how to get the correct value from your data
`.value((d) => d.some.deep.value)`.

Scales are mathmatical functions that map a domain to a range.
Domain tells the scale the extent of the data, range tells the scale the extent of our drawing area.

A linear scale with domain[0, 100] and a range [1, 2] for scale(50) will return 1.5.

Scales don't care about the object they are applied to, they only care about mapping a domain to a range.
