# Journal Ideas

**Day to page in A6 notebook**

Some days 1/2 to 3/4 of the page will be empty, but we can backfill that space with inspirational quotes etc as we go. It looks cleaner and gets around the issue where I remember something for a previous day but have no space left to enter it.

**Throw away task lists**

Keep an index card with journal to write daily tasks on and tick off against. This saves cluttering each day up with just tasks, and any left over after a few days / end of the week can be logged as ongoing tasks that need performing, if they are still important enough for consideration.
