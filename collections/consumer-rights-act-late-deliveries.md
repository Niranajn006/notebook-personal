# Consumer Rights Act and late deliveries

Flowers ordered well in advance of required event date, with order confirmation showing a guaranteed delivery date of the 8th March, which was the required event date (Womens day). Flowers never arrived on the event date. Neither have they arrived on the days following the event date.

A contract was entered into with Amazon marketplace for delivery on 8th March - these terms were not fulfilled therefore the terms of the contract were breached. There were no extenuating 'weather conditions' in Edinburgh, all services returned to normal a week ago, and on the event date it was sunny and clear. As this order was never fulfilled, and the contract broken, I require a FULL refund for failure to deliver goods by the promised date.




If you paid for delivery by a certain date or time (eg by Christmas or next-day delivery) and the delivery arrives late, this is a breach of contract.

If it was essential that your goods were delivered on time, you have the right to terminate the purchase and get a full refund.

But if it wasn’t clear to the retailer at the point of purchase that it was essential and you didn’t make them aware you needed your goods delivered by a certain date or time frame, you should give them another opportunity to deliver your goods.


The Consumer Rights Act 2015 says that unless a specific time frame is agreed for delivery, the retailer must deliver them within 30 days of when you placed your order.

If you told the supplier when you first ordered the goods that delivery within a certain time frame was essential, or you can show that it should have been clear or obvious to the retailer that it was essential, then you don’t need to give a further opportunity to deliver.

Under the Consumer Rights Act you are required to deliver the [item] to me at the agreed time. As I have still not received [item], and it is past the agreed time, I believe you’re in breach of contract.

Failure to deliver within a reasonable time and outside of the agreed deadline is considered to be a breach of contract.

(c)the consumer told the trader before the contract was entered into that delivery in accordance with paragraph (3), or at the agreed time or within the agreed period, was essential,

(7) In any other circumstances, the consumer may specify a period that is appropriate in the circumstances and require the trader to deliver the goods before the end of that period.

(8) If the consumer specifies a period under paragraph (7) but the goods are not delivered within that period, then the consumer may treat the contract as at an end.

(9) If the consumer treats the contract as at an end under paragraph (6) or (8), the trader must without undue delay reimburse all payments made under the contract.

A contract was entered for the guaranteed delivery of flowers by 8th March 2018 for Womens day. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, section 28, subsections 4 and 6, there was an agreed time for delivery of the goods.

To date, the flowers have still not been received. There were no extenuating 'weather conditions' in Edinburgh, all services returned to normal a week ago, and on the agreed delivery date it was sunny and clear.

Failure to deliver by the agreed time constitutes a breach of contract; under section 28, subsection 8, I consider the contract at an end. Therefore, I am terminating the purchase and you are under obligation under subsection 9 to reimburse all payments made under the contract without delay.

As such I expect a FULL and immediate refund.
