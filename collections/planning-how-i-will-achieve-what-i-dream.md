# Planning How I Will Achieve What I Dream

> Ambition without action is fantasy. Set a goal, write it down and get started. Don't think forever. Don't plan forever. Don't dream forever. Dreaming is not enough without the doing! - Bryant McGill

The technique below takes inspiration from a process we use at work, but I've deliberately trimmed parts of it to fit my personal circumstances.

- avoids too much upfront planning

- gets completed tasks delivered as quickly possible

- reduces the amount of work we start doing, but then shelve and never finish

> "In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable" - Dwight D. Eisenhower.

My main concern is it's just a displacement activity, talking about what I'll do rather than actually producing anything of value. However as the quote above states, I think the process of planning whether something is impactful, achievable, and how I will achieve the goal, will be a useful exercise in itself.

Something being interesting will no longer be good enough, the process will force me to think about realistically what will I gain from spending time on a project.

The goal is to start something and finish it; one of my biggest issues is procrastination so I'm constantly getting distracted and end up with many different projects all limping along robbing my focus at the same time.

Trying to force myself to stick to a small WIP limit and finish what I start I hope will result in added motivation, as I actually start seeing measurable progress stack up.

One of the biggest aspects of this is learning data science skills; because it is such a wide and interesting field touching upon all areas, I'm trying to learn everything, at the same time. To combat this I want to put some form of a learning plan in place (and try to stick to it), then I can start seeing defined progress and measure improvement.

For each piece of work I want to commit to S.M.A.R.T. goals so I can see progression:

- Specific

- Measurable

- Attainable

- Relevant

- Time-bound

## Initiatives

Initiatives are the tangible concept of an idea for something that will help me get closer to achieving my current goals.

- They have a very explicit definition of what DONE looks like so I know when they are completed

- Each initiative will be S.M.A.R.T. so weekly progress and impact can be assessed
  - the measures themselves are not the goal (leading indicators rather than lagging)

- Initiatives should be created to form alignment towards goals and prioritise work towards the highest value objectives

- I should fail fast on intitiatives and stop work that is not valuable or having any traction, in favour of more valuable work

- Initiatives are progressed via weekly goals to keep me motivated with constant progress

- An initiative is a organic document, so it will continue to evolve, be updated and improve over time

- As I discover things that change my thinking I will update the initiative to reflect them

## Process

`Ideas -> Prospects (Later) -> Inception (Next) -> Action (Now) -> Done`

At *Prospects* onwards we should apply Kanban WIP limits to prevent trying to work on everything at the same time.

### Ideas

- Every initiative starts life as an "idea".

- At this stage, it is little more than a heading and a paragraph describing:
  - what the expected impact would be
  - how it aligns to my goals

### Prospects

- On an unscheduled basis review the ideas

- Look for which "ideas" are impactful enough to justify spending personal time on

- Extend the detail captured in "ideas" to cover the headings in the initiative template at a high level

- "Prospects" form a holding area for possible things to work on when I have the capacity to move them to "inception"

### Inception

- In this phase take the simplified intention and develop it further

- The goal is to develop enough detail to know if there is enough value and technical feasibility to perform the work and test assumptions against

- Time box the inception phase (1 week?) and set it as an explicit target to mark as completed

- Produce the following outputs as deliverables:
  - single page write up describing the impact this initiative will have, and how to measure when the work is done
  - steps to achieve the idea, with enough detail to measure progress against the overall idea deliverable
  - for technical projects this will consider the implementation in enough detail to determine if it is achievable and what approach to take
  - the first two time boxed goals; detailing the period they are expected to take, the assumptions that will be tested and what impact these will have

- At this point, make a Commit/Drop decision whether to take the time to commit to completing this initiative
