# Looking for a data scientist

[Wanted: A Data Scientist](http://datawanderings.com/2017/10/02/data-scientist-wanted/)

> My belief is that fishing for a Data Scientist ‘superstar’ is often counterproductive and inevitably leads to a realisation that one person cannot do it all. Instead, investing in appropriate training of the current staff can lead to long-lasting benefits for the company.

> The word has it that a Data Scientist is this elusive hybrid of a programmer, a statistician, and a business analyst. 

> To see how absurd the expectations about a Data Scientist’s skill-set got, look at what seems to be a LinkedIn-wide agreement on their resume: a proficiency in 4 programming languages, an understanding of distributed computing, a PhD in Physics or Engineering, communication and presentation skills, and preferably some production system administrator experience.

> The eclectic mix of competencies that define the role makes it close to impossible to find a person who could fill it. Accumulating this sort of knowledge – unless you are a Silicon Valley-bred engineer with a lot of time on your hands and unlimited funding – takes years. It requires practice, enthusiasm, and luck as you would need to have worked on very distinct projects in the past, and covering various roles while on it. No wonder the market struggles with filling the Data Scientist vacancies. 

> In expanding the search for the data magician to job boards, the organisations miss on building on knowledge they already have – and, instead, opt for starting from scratch.

> From the cost perspective, it is more feasible to invest in current staff than hire externally. Yet to some it sounds too far-fetched. Isn’t there risk that throwing all that money onto an existing employee training would be a) a waste of time, or b) result in the person skilling up and leaving the parents’ house?

> Undoubtedly, the cost/risk calculation is a balancing act, but less straightforward than it looks like. Yes, it costs time and money to get people trained. But neither is it cheap to get somebody new on-board. The cost of recruitment can run into months; then there will be monthly spending on the hire’s attractive salary; let’s also consider the time it takes for the person to know your business, the processes, and people.

> There are organisations who can afford a landslide business transformation, but most companies need and benefit from organic growth. An equivalent of the latter in Data Science terms is investing internally and growing the resources you already have.

> People, even the most talented people, do not grow new skills overnight.

> What’s happening in Silicon Valley gets to the industry in years time and in a striped down form. It can be that Reinforcement Learning has got the potential to change programming as we know it (or at least Go tournaments), but currently there are only few people who can implement, or even understand its workings.

> At the moment, creating a simple decision tree is a game changer for many: an analysis most of us can understand, design, test, and apply. A decision tree can turn a company’s approach by 180°, challenging former assumptions through look at patterns in customer behaviour.

> Below are some thoughts on the problem and a handful of approaches to consider. I have called the list the art of taking steps back because it is not focused on learning new skills or technologies. Instead, I look at strengthening the knowledge foundation of the team and revising the core business problems. One step back at the time.

1. Where does your data live, can the rest of the business get to it, and can they use it by themselves?

> Getting a grip of the corporate information architecture is a standard requirement for any data science project: you cannot predict the future if you don’t understand the past.

> What’s the best route onto learning the ‘Data Scientist toolkit’? There is an abundance of compilation blog posts with all the courses one can take to become a  great data scientist. These courses are very popular and I admire the determination of people who pass them. My feeling though – but keep in mind I’m a comfortable European 9-to-5 worker – is that many people in full employment find these training unrealistic to complete. Rarely we are given an opportunity to spend a considerable chunk of office hours on studying a technology that is only potentially useful. Out of office hours are tricky if you have a family, a social life, or a sports routine you’d like to maintain. I don’t think I have to convince anybody that the most natural way to learn is on the go.

What projects do we have at work where I could implement ML or exploratory analysis?

> My approach to learning or investing in a team’s skill set would be to base it on a project’s ROI: work on solutions that can bring potential future benefits.
