Over the last few months as I've been looking into machine learning systems I keep seeing patterns and pain points that software engineering has been through, which got me wondering if we can use those lessons already learnt and apply them inside the DS space.

So I've started reading more on what others are doing and how they approach some scenarios. Below are a couple of papers I found interesting on the topic (the references also link to other good papers), if this is a topic people are interested in let me know and I'll post things here as I come across them, or use a focused group to avoid spamming everyone.

Azure ML

Portfolio piece as building an ML platform.

Areas to demonstrate ability:

- exploratory analysis and write up

- ML pipeline (training, modelling, deployment, monitoring, updating)

- data product

Blog area around developing ML platform and pipelines, summarising and referencing read papers and blogs.

- maybe look at writing a paper pulling a lot of the concepts together?
