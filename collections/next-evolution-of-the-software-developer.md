# The next evolution of the software developer

Patterns are starting to emerge where projects involving data processing using explicit programming logic are being improved by applying machine learning approaches. Examples within Google span a number of fields such as data center energy usage, solving go, language translation etc.

If you think about the number of areas where machine learning can be applied with less errors than human processing then it starts to look like this will be a significantly growing field, with a shift from traditional programming to augmenting or replacing implementations with deep learning (what Andrej Karpathy calls 'Software 2.0').

This is quite a change in approaching a software project. 

Software approaches are constantly evolving and adapting, this is an exciting time to be in the industry as the whole discipline is fundamentally shifting. Instead of writing and maintaining intricate, layered tangles of logic the developer is moving to being a teacher of machines instead, curating data and analysing the results.

Short to mid term combining programming skills with machine learning skills will probably be the most impactful, as the industry sees what approaches and techniques work. We will see ML tools and environments continue to grow as we seek to reduce the pain or drag in a project performing similar tasks over and over again. As these approaches mature and frameworks and harnesses become popular and established we will probably see a shift more towards ML knowledge, to tailor and optimise the generic implementations we start with as the baseline.

Moving towards more domain knowledge, than technical programming knowledge. By training a machine by providing examples of inputs with the desired outputs you expect to see, the tooling will enable you to build your own products, rather than providing user stories to a team of developers to turn into a product.

We see examples of this already with things like Ubers Michealangelo, where they built a data platform to enable anyone to analyse and work with their data, traditionally only the province of data scientists and analysts.

### Google and Ubers best practices for deep learning

> Software engineering practices such as Test Driven Development (TDD), continuous integration, rollback and recovery, change control etc. are being introduced into advanced machine learning practices. It is not enough for a specialist to develop on a Jupyter notebook and throw it over the wall to a team to make operational. The same end-to-end devops practices that we find today in the best engineering companies are also going to be demanded in machine learning endeavors.
